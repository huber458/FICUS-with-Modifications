# FICUS-with-Modifications
FICUS as used in Huberty et al. 2025 (see https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250113899H/abstract)
Based on Saldana-Lopez et al. 2023 (see https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.6295S/abstract) 
Please be sure to cite the Saldana-Lopez paper too!
Saldana-Lopez gives a great overview of the base FICUS code. 

Further Modifications Made in Huberty et al. 2025:
1. Addition of damping wing system, characterized by a column density, N.
--> Both with and with out an ionized bubble. 
2. Addition of IGM absorption, originally based on from of Miralda-Escude 1998 characterized by x_HI (the neutral Hydrogen Fraction).
--> Can comment out this part of the code as needed.
3. Conversion to MCMC method of fitting from gradient descent.
